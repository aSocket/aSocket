## Bug Reports
Do you believe you've found a bug that you'd like to report? Please follow the following steps to do so.
1. Ensure you're using the up-to-date software, as the bug may have been patched in an update. If it isn't up to date, please update and ensure the bug is still present.
2. Review the [current issues](https://github.com/aSocket/aSocket/labels/bug), and ensure someone else hasn't already reported the bug. (If they have, please don't open duplicate reports, as they'll be closed right away)
3. If the bug is still present and no one has reported it, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/aSocket/aSocket/issues/new/choose) using the bug report template, and ensure you fill in as much information as possible for us to be able to reproduce the issue and patch it. Failure to provide enough information will lead to your issue being closed.

## Feature Requests
Have a feature you believe should be added? Please follow the following steps to make your suggestion!
1. Review the [current feature requests](https://github.com/aSocket/aSocket/labels/enhancement), and ensure someone else hasn't created a similar suggestion. (If they have, and you'd like to see the feature added, rather than opening a new request, mention in the open request that you'd like to see that feature added. The more demand a feature has, the more likely it'll be added.)
2. If no one has suggested your feature, please [open a new request](https://github.com/aSocket/aSocket/issues/new/choose) using the feature request template.
